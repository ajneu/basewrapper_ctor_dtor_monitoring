# basewrapper_ctor_dtor_monitoring

Nice wrappers for monitoring constructor/destructor behaviour, 
as well as tracking object-instances "of the same value" (due to copy construction, copy-assignment) 
via reference countring. 

Memory for e.g. ref counters is either automatically allocated on the heap (if constructor passed nullptr) 
or can be passed in from the outside (as non-nullptr that typically points to the stack).
